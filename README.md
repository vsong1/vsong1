### 🐣 About Me
- ✏️: I'm studying Data Science in Informatics with a minor in Business at Emory University
- 👩‍🎓: I'm graduating in May 2026
- 😄: My pronouns are she/her/hers
- 🔭: I'm looking for a career in data science or analytics

### 🎯 Featured Project
Check out my work on this Bayesian regression project for Estée Lauder! My team and I developed a RDD model to analyze the effect of surprise gifts on retail customer spend, helping the company determine the effectiveness of this marketing tactic.

- Tools: Python, NumPyro, statsmodels 
- What We Did: Used regression statistics (R-squared, Levene's stat) to determine appropriate range of customer spend for model, then built and compared OLS and Bayesian regression discontinuity models
- Results: Observed similarities in OLS and Bayesian results, and determined with 95% confidence an overall positive ROI for Estée Lauder's surprise gift campaign.
